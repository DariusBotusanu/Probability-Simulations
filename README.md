# Probability-Simulations
Small programs that simulate random events and compares their simulated probability to their real probability of occurring.
Some of the programs are based on the book "Probability Theory, Examples, Problems, Simulations" by  Hannelore Lisei, Wilfried Grecksch and Mihai Iancu

However, the programs will often display more information than what is it required. The real probabilitites of the events are computed with steps in the book
and they are an effective way to sharpen one's analytical skills.

The Stochastic Processes section also has plots for some programs for visualising the process (e.g. drunken_walk from Markov Chains)

An Extra section was added. It is an independent section with problems unrelated to the book, but I felt it fit in the
project as it is ultimately on the same topic: probability simulations.
