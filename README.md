# Probability-Simulations
FOR POTENTIAL RECRUITERS: Stochastic Processes: Markov chains is the most relevant folder so far if you only want to have a quick view over the project.

Small programs that simulate random events and compares their simulated probability to their real probability of occurring.

Some of the programs are based on the book "Probability Theory, Examples, Problems, Simulations" by  Hannelore Lisei, Wilfried Grecksch and Mihai Iancu

For Markov chains the main source Olle Häggström: Finite Markov Chains and Algorithmic Applications. While this book is focused on the mathematical properties of Markov Chains (although there are plenty real-world examples) rather than their actual implementation, it proves to be an amazing book at grasping the properties and uses of finite Markov chains with discrete time.

The Stochastic Processes section also has plots for some programs for visualising the process (e.g. drunken_walk from Markov Chains)

The Extra section contains programs that have yet to fall under a category, they are mainly oriented around tring to implement some theoretical concepts.
