Mrs. Y and Mr. X take their dogs for a walk every day in
a pocket park. Mrs. Y arrives in the park at 12 and T minutes and walks
her dog for 15 minutes. Mr. X arrives in the park at 13 and S minutes
and walks his dog for 10 minutes. Suppose that T and S are independent
uniformly distributed random variables on the intervals [30, 50], respectively
[âˆ’20, 10].

What we will do:
    -   compute by simulations the probability that Mrs. Y and Mr. X
        meet in the park when they walk their dogs.

Note: the theoretical probability is 0.5
